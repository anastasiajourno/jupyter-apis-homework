# What the assignment was about
For me, it was more about using **Jupyter**, 
building on the things we learned about APIs and lists before

# Something you learned in the process
- The order in which you run cells in **Jupyter** matters.  
- So does the number of times you run the code.

# Something you found challenging
Hiding _API_ keys =)
